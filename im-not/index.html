      <p>Just kidding ü•∏</p>

      <p>If you are reading this then I am now publicly out. The point of this letter is to tell you that I am trans and provide some explanation to help you understand what that means (to be clear, this is a ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù letter and I am actually trans, the title is a joke).</p>

      <p>Here are the major bullet points</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have always pushed away and denied the thoughts of being happier as a girl since a young age</li>
        <li>I have been in such a deep denial that I never thought I actually could be trans</li>
        <li>I accepted that I was trans last November and have been figuring it all out since then</li>
        <li>I am not making any big changes to the way I publicly identify or express myself at this time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If taking all this in is making your brain explode a bit, now would be a good time to just take a moment and breathe. Everything is okay, we are all going to die. Maybe go get some water or something.</p>

      <p>I understand that this news is a bit of a bomb drop and might be hard to immediately understand and accept. Accepting this about myself was something that I had a pretty difficult time doing as well. I‚Äôve spent the majority of my life in complete denial over this part of myself. It was always easier to ignore these feelings than to do anything about them. There was always some other explanation I could convince myself with. If I actively didn‚Äôt want to be trans, how could I possibly be trans? If I was never going to address that part of myself anyway, then what did it matter? These, among many other reasons, are how I was able to happily remain in denial for so long. When the alternative was actually accepting that I might be trans and everything that comes with that, it wasn‚Äôt that difficult to just ignore that part of myself.</p>

      <p>Staying in denial was also a lot easier when I was younger and had a lot more short-term goals and distractions in life. The two years after I graduated college were in general just more gray and cloudy than any before, and I developed some bad habits with binge eating and alcohol abuse. Neither of those issues ever got to a point where I felt as though I needed help specifically for those problems, but I could tell I was not moving in a good direction.</p>

      <p>I think these problems that I was experiencing gave me a little push to look inward a bit and explore why I was coping and latching onto these bad habits. It wasn‚Äôt super intentional, but during some random week last November I just fell down the right rabbit hole that totally broke me down and got me out of denial. Everything I was reading was undeniably relatable and I started to have panic attacks as I internalized that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live my life without regret if I ignored this part of myself forever.</p>

      <p>That week ended with me telling Lexie, which is also really the moment that I feel like I came out to myself as well. Having a partner like Lexie to go through this with has been an enormous blessing. I am really at a loss for how to articulate how supportive, loving, and pure of a person she is. She deserves all the support in the world and I encourage you to give her that support in any way that you can.</p>

      <p>I quickly found an amazing therapist who has helped me understand myself better and break down a lot of internalized transphobia. Before starting therapy, I was extremely overwhelmed and confused about how to move forward. It seemed as though I had a mountain of impossible tasks and decisions ahead of me. The reality is that I've just been taking small steps towards embracing this part of myself more when I feel comfortable and have the motivation to do so. Some of those steps are larger and scarier than others, but each scary step so far has just been a day that comes and goes and gets replaced by some other worry.</p>

      <p>Embracing this side of myself has been a really positive experience so far. Overall I feel a lot happier with myself, I care more about my physical health than I ever have in my life, and I am looking forward to the future. Being out of denial and getting all of this out of my brain and into the open has been the biggest weight off my shoulder and I can really see the difference it makes for my mental health.</p>

      <p>Ultimately I have no idea where I‚Äôm going to end up and I purposely try not to put much focus on that. I have no goals aside from just being a happier and more genuine version of myself, and I honestly feel as though I‚Äôve already succeeded in that. My focus for now is to position myself in a place where I feel comfortable and safe to continually explore who I am further at my own pace, and putting out this letter is a part of that process. I‚Äôm not concerned with labels or attempting to put myself into any boxes. When I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trans‚Äù, I mean I am somewhere within that umbrella term. I don‚Äôt know exactly where and I‚Äôm okay with that.</p>

      <p>For now, I am most comfortable just being able to blend into society as I always have. In other words, the next time you see me you likely wouldn‚Äôt know about any of this had you not read this letter. If you've seen me at all in the past 6 months then you've already experienced the person you'll see for the next 6 months. You can refer to me as you always have and ideally just work on getting more comfortable with the idea that I‚Äôm somewhere under that trans umbrella.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôd also like to mention that me taking 20 years to get here is in no way indicative of my upbringing. My parents have been nothing but supportive and I never doubted that would be the case. Ultimately I feel very privileged to be in a position where I feel safe and supported enough to say all this publicly, as many people do not have that same type of support. If you‚Äôd like to read more about what it‚Äôs like to be trans or experience gender dysphoria I‚Äôd recommend this great resource:</p>

      <p>If you can make it through that without having a panic attack, then congrats, you probably aren‚Äôt trans.</p>

      <p>I'd also also like to mention that making this personal public proclamation and sending it to everyone I know is a bit nightmarish. I am a mostly quiet person and I don't like occupying a ton of space in other's minds. I am proud of myself for doing this, but to me, this day is something I look forward to having further behind me. I hope this information did not come at an inconvenient time for anyone.</p>

      <p>Special thanks to anyone in my life that has ever put themselves out there in spite of what society or others has expected from them. This process would be a lot scarier for me had you not given our families and friends the opportunities to show their love and support. Please feel free to reach out with any questions/concerns/support.</p>

        Thanks for reading<br/>
